# Machine-Learning_KMeans-Clustering_Image-compression
Images  compression is done by converting the pixels in numpy arrays and then using Kmeans Clustering classification algorithm to compress all colors to selected 'k' colors. An interactive control is also setup fro direct access of images from directory and using slider to denote 'k' value from 1 to 256
